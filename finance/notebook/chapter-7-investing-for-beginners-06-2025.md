# Chapter 7: Investing for Beginners  
*"Let your money earn while you sleep."*

## Why I Started Investing

I used to think saving was enough. But saving just keeps my money safe — it doesn't grow it.  
With rising prices (inflation), if I don’t invest, my money loses value every year.

> Investing isn’t just for the rich — it’s for anyone who wants a better future.

## What I Mean By Investing

Investing = Putting money into something that can grow in value or earn income over time.

Examples I use or consider:
- Mutual funds (SIP)  
- Stocks  
- PPF/NPS  
- Gold (Digital/ETF)  
- Real estate

## My 3 Starter Questions

1. **Why am I investing?** (Goal-based)  
2. **How long can I leave the money invested?**  
3. **How much risk can I handle without losing sleep?**

## Why I Love SIPs

**SIP = Systematic Investment Plan**  
I invest a fixed amount monthly in a mutual fund.

**Why I Like It:**
- Auto-deducted — no excuses
- Starts as low as ₹500/month
- Averages out market ups and downs
- Grows with compounding over time

---

### SIP Growth Example

If I invest ₹5,000/month at ~12% return:

| **Time**  | **Value Grows To** |
|-----------|--------------------|
| 5 years   | ₹4.1 lakhs         |
| 10 years  | ₹11.6 lakhs        |
| 20 years  | ₹49.9 lakhs        |

That’s why I say — **small amounts add up big if you’re patient.**

---

## Simple Allocation Rules I Use

- **“100 minus age” rule for equities:**  
> E.g. Age 30 → 70% in equities/stocks, 30% safer options.

---

### My Favourite Option

> **Index Funds.**  
Low cost, no active management needed.  
I just invest and forget. Historically ~10–12% annual returns.

---

## My Risk-Based Allocation Ideas

**Conservative (Low Risk):**
- 70% zero-risk (FD/PPF)
- 25% medium-risk (Debt Funds/NPS)
- 5% high-risk (Equity MFs/Stocks)

**Balanced (Medium Risk):**
- 40% zero-risk
- 40% medium-risk
- 20% high-risk

**Aggressive (High Risk):**
- 20% zero-risk
- 30% medium-risk
- 50% high-risk

> I pick what suits my comfort, not trends.
