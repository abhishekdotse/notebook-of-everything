# Chapter 10: Understanding Financial Regulators in India  
*"Trust, but verify — that’s why regulators exist."*

## Why I Care About This

When I put my money in banks, mutual funds, insurance, or pensions, I’m trusting someone else with it.  

- But who makes sure they follow the rules?  
- Who protects me from fraud or unfair treatment?  

That’s the job of **financial regulators**. They keep our money system safe, fair, and transparent.
