# Chapter 4: Save Smart, Live Smart  
*"Don’t save what is left after spending. Spend what is left after saving." – Warren Buffett*

## Why I Started Saving Differently

I used to think I just needed to earn more to feel financially secure.  
But then I realized: **without saving first, more money just means more spending.**

Doesn’t matter if I earn ₹20K or ₹2L — if I don’t save **before** spending, I often end up with nothing by month-end.

## What Saving Really Means (For Me)

Saving = Money I **set aside with intention** — for emergencies, future goals, or investing.  

That doesn’t include:
- Whatever is left at the end of the month  
- Gold I buy randomly  
- Money sitting in my low-interest bank account doing nothing

## My 3 Golden Saving Rules

### 1. **Pay Myself First**

Before I pay bills, I move money to:
- My SIP  
- My RD or PPF  
- Emergency Fund

**Automate it** with standing instructions so I don’t forget.

---

### 2. **Make It a Habit**

Started with:
- ₹500/month SIP  
- ₹1,000 RD  
- ₹100/week cash savings jar  

Small amounts helped me get into the rhythm — and it feels good watching it grow.

## How Much Should I Save?

I started with **20% of my income** — and aim for 30% now.

| **Monthly Income** | **Target Saving (20%)** |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| ₹25,000            | ₹5,000                   |
| ₹50,000            | ₹10,000                  |
| ₹75,000            | ₹15,000                  |
| ₹1,00,000          | ₹20,000                  |

Even **₹2,000/month in SIPs** can become **₹6–7 lakhs in 10 years**.  
That’s the power of consistency.

## Saving vs Investing (I Keep It Simple)

| **Aspect**       | **Saving**               | **Investing**                     |
|------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Purpose          | Safety, emergency fund   | Grow wealth, reach long-term goals|
| Returns          | Low, fixed               | Higher, but variable              |
| Risk             | Very low                 | Depends on where I invest         |
| Tools            | FD, RD, PPF              | Mutual Funds, Stocks, NPS         |
| Time Horizon     | Short–Medium             | Medium–Long                       |

I save for peace of mind, and invest to grow money for future goals.

## How I Handle My Salary: A Simple System That Works

One thing that really changed my money habits was this:  
**The moment my salary hits, I don’t leave it sitting there.**

Here’s what I do — maybe it’ll work for you too:

### My 3-Account Rule

| **Account Type**     | **Purpose**                               |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Salary Account       | Where my income lands                     |
| Expenses Account     | Monthly spending money (rent, groceries)  |
| Savings Account      | For saving and investing only             |

### My Flow (Right After Salary Is Credited)

1. **Transfer a fixed amount to my savings account**  
   This goes into SIPs, RDs, PPF, or gold over the month

2. **Move my monthly budget into my expenses account**  
   Rent, food, transport — all spend from this account

3. **Leave the salary account nearly empty**  
   This way, I don’t accidentally spend what I meant to save

### A Trick That Helps:
> Whatever is *left* in the **expense account** at month-end is **next month’s buffer** — or bonus savings!

It’s a simple system — but it gave me structure, clarity, and reduced my stress about money.

## Quick Reminders I Gave Myself

- **Save before you spend** — not after  
- Automate it — remove the friction  
- Don’t let money just sit — put it to work  
- Small amounts saved regularly = big wins later  
- Choose tools based on what I’m saving for (not just returns)

Saving gave me breathing space, peace of mind, and the confidence to plan ahead.  
It’s the *quiet superpower* that changed how I look at money.
