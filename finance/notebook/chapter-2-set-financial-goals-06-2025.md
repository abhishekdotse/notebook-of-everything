# Chapter 2: Set Financial Goals  
*“If you don’t know where you're going, any road will take you there.”*

## Why I Needed This Chapter

I used to save money randomly — a bit here, a bit there. But I never knew *what* I was saving for. That changed once I started writing down my goals.

A **financial goal** just means giving your money a job:  
> “What do I want to do with my money, and by when?”

## My Goal Types (With Examples)

| **Goal Type**   | **Time Frame** | **Examples**                                 |
|------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Short-Term       | 0–3 years      | Emergency fund, phone upgrade, vacation       |
| Medium-Term      | 3–7 years      | Wedding, car, higher studies                  |

## The SMART Goal Trick

I follow the **SMART method** when writing financial goals:

- **S**pecific → What exactly do I want?  
- **M**easurable → How much money is needed?  
- **A**chievable → Can I afford it?  
- **R**ealistic → Is it doable with my income/lifestyle?  
- **T**ime-bound → By when?

Example:  
> “Save ₹10 lakhs for my daughter’s MBA in 10 years.”

## Quick Estimate: How Much Should I Save?

Here’s the basic idea:  
> The earlier I start, the less I have to save each month.

### Rough Estimate Example:

Let’s say I want ₹10 lakhs in 10 years.  
I invest in a mutual fund expecting 10% annual returns.

- One-time: Save ₹4 lakhs now  
- OR Monthly: Save ~₹6,000 through SIP

It doesn’t have to be perfect — just start planning early.
