*"Your credit score is your financial reputation."*

## Why I Care About My Credit Score

A good credit score isn’t just for fancy credit cards.  
It helps me:
- Get home, car, or personal loans at lower interest rates
- Avoid loan rejection stress
- Even helps with rental agreements or job checks sometimes

> It’s like my *financial trust score*.

## What’s a Credit Score?

A **3-digit number (300–900)** showing how well I handle borrowing.  

- Higher score = Banks trust me more.  
- Lower score = I pay more in interest or get rejected.

## Credit Bureaus in India

Places that calculate and track my score:

- **CIBIL** (most used)  
- Equifax  
- CRIF High Mark  
- Experian

## What’s a Good Score?

| **Score Range** | **Meaning**                          |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 750–900          | Excellent → Easy approvals          |
| 700–749          | Good → Usually approved             |
| 650–699          | Fair → Costlier, less reliable      |
| Below 650        | Poor → High rejection risk          |

- My aim = 750+ for peace of mind.

## What Boosts My Score?

1. Paying EMIs and credit card bills on time  
2. Using less than 30% of my credit limit  
3. Keeping old credit accounts open  
4. Having a mix of loan types (home, personal, credit card)  

---

## What Hurts My Score?

1. Missing payments  
2. Maxing out credit cards  
3. Too many loan applications at once  
4. Defaulting or settling loans badly  

---

## My Credit Card Rule

**Keep usage below 30% of the limit.**  
If limit = ₹1,00,000 → Use ~₹30,000 max.  
> High usage regularly = Banks see me as risky.
