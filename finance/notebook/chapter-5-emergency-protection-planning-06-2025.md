# Chapter 5: Emergency & Protection Planning  
*"Build your roof before it rains."*

## Why I Made This a Priority

One unexpected hospital bill or job loss can wipe out years of savings.  
Planning for emergencies and having the right insurance is like **building a safety net for life’s surprises**.

This chapter is about how *I* prepared for the stuff I hope never happens.

## Part 1: My Emergency Fund — First Line of Defense

### What Is It?

Money set aside for real emergencies:
- Job loss
- Medical expenses
- Car/home repairs
- Family crises

It’s **not** for impulse shopping or sales!

---

### How Much Do I Keep?

**Rule of thumb:**  
- 3–6 months of essential expenses.

| Monthly Expenses | Emergency Fund Target |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| ₹20,000           | ₹60,000 – ₹1,20,000  |
| ₹40,000           | ₹1,20,000 – ₹2,40,000|
| ₹70,000           | ₹2,10,000 – ₹4,20,000|

---

### Where Do I Park It?

- **Bank savings account** (instant access)
- **Liquid mutual funds** (better returns)
- **Short-term RDs/FDs** (for laddering)

Avoid keeping large cash at home or locking it all in long-term FDs.

### My Laddering Strategy

I split my emergency fund so it's easy to use *and* grows a bit:

| **Tier** | **% of Fund** | **Where**                 |
|----------|----------------|--------------------------|
| 1        | 40%            | Savings account          |
| 2        | 30%            | Liquid mutual fund       |
| 3        | 30%            | Short-term RD or FD      |

This balance helps with **liquidity + some returns**.

## Part 2: Insurance — My Backup Plan

Insurance is not an investment. It’s **protection**.  
When life hits hard, insurance means you (or your family) won't face a financial disaster.

### Types of Insurance I Considered Essential

#### **1. Term Life Insurance** (If someone depends on me)

- Cheapest way to get high cover  
- Recommended = **10–20× annual income**  
- Buy early — premiums stay fixed for life and are cheaper at a young age

**Why I Chose It:**  
> It's simple: if I’m gone, my family still gets financial security.

**Quick Tips I Noted for Myself:**
- Use online [**Human Life Value Calculators**](https://www.iciciprulife.com/insurance-guide/financial-planning-tools-calculators/human-life-value-calculator.html) to choose the right sum assured.
- Don’t overthink riders in one policy. I prefer buying **pure term insurance** and getting health/accident/critical illness cover separately.
- Premiums can be monthly or annual — I chose what fits my cash flow.  
- I avoid **single-premium or limited-payment schemes** that look cheap upfront — investing the difference elsewhere (like index funds) can grow much more over time.
- I set coverage until the age I expect to be financially independent (e.g. till retirement or kids start earning).
- Chose insurer with **high claim settlement ratio** and **high amount settlement ratio**.
- Added my loved ones as **nominees**, split as needed.

> For me, term insurance isn't about returns. It's pure protection, so my family is safe if I'm not around.

---

#### **2. Health Insurance**

-  Minimum ₹5–10L cover (₹25L+ for family floater)  
-  Even with employer cover, I got personal insurance

> Medical costs rise fast. A ₹1L surgery can ruin savings. Health insurance means I can focus on getting better, not paying bills.

---

#### **3. Personal Accident Insurance**

- Covers death or disability from accidents  
- Inexpensive but vital

**Key Coverages to Look For:**
- Accidental Death: 10× annual income
- Permanent Total Disability
- Permanent Partial Disability
- Temporary Total Disability
- Worldwide coverage (for travel)

> Accidents can hurt earning ability, not just health.

---

#### **4. Critical Illness Insurance**

- Lump-sum payout on diagnosis of major illness  
- Useful for expensive treatments (cancer, heart surgery)

**What I Check:**
- ₹5–10L cover minimum
- 0-day survival period
- Short waiting period
- Covers many illnesses
- Worldwide treatment included

> Helps manage massive hospital bills that normal health insurance may not fully cover.

---

#### **5. Home Insurance**

- Protects my house and contents from fire, flood, theft  
- Low yearly premium

> Peace of mind for my biggest asset.

---

#### **6. Motor Insurance**

- Mandatory in India  
- Covers damage to my car/bike and third-party liability

> A legal must-have, and useful for expensive repairs.

## Quick Protection Checklist

## My Personal Takeaways

- Emergencies will happen — plan before they do

- Buy only what I need, keep it simple

**I don’t buy insurance to get rich. I buy it so I don’t get poor if something goes wrong.**  
That mindset changed how I feel about money.
