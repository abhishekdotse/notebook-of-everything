# Chapter 6: Handling Debt the Right Way  
*"Borrow wisely, repay reliably, live freely."*

## Why I Wrote This

I used to think all debt was bad. But I learned it’s not about avoiding debt — it’s about **managing it smartly**.

Debt can help you buy a home or study. But if it’s unmanaged, it eats your peace of mind.

## What I Call Debt

Debt = Money I borrow and must repay with interest.

Examples in my life:
- Home loan
- Car loan
- Credit cards
- Education loan
- Personal loan
- Buy-now-pay-later apps

## Good Debt vs Bad Debt (My Simple Rule)

| **Good Debt**             | **Why I Accept It**               |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Home loan, education loan | Builds my future value/skills     |

| **Bad Debt**              | **Why I Avoid It**                |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Credit cards, personal loan | Funds short-term wants, costly |

> For me: **Good debt helps me grow. Bad debt funds impulse spending.**

## How I Check If I Have Too Much Debt

I use a simple rule:

**Debt-to-Income Ratio = EMIs ÷ Monthly Income**

- I keep it **below 30%** so I’m comfortable.

**Example:**  
- Income: ₹60,000  
- EMIs: ₹20,000  
- DTI = 33% → Time to reduce!

## How I Work on Reducing Debt

### Prioritize Repayments

I choose a method that fits me:
- **Snowball:** Pay off smallest loan first (motivating)  
- **Avalanche:** Pay highest-interest first (cheaper)

---

### Consolidate or Refinance

I ask my bank:
- Can I get a lower interest rate?
- Can I combine loans into one manageable EMI?

---

### Sell Stuff I Don’t Need

I’ve sold:
- Old gold
- Unused gadgets
- Extra bike

Used the money to pay loans faster.

---

### Avoid New Debt

- No new EMIs until old ones are cleared.  
- Reduced credit card limit to control temptation.  
- If income increases, I increase repayments — not my lifestyle.

## My Simple Debt Log

| **Loan**       | **EMI ₹** | **Action**         |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------------|
| Personal Loan   | ₹5,000    | Refinance          |
| Car Loan        | ₹7,000    | Pay off early      |
| Credit Card     | ₹3,000    | Pay in full monthly|

---

## What I Avoid Now

- Only paying credit card minimum  
- Borrowing to repay another loan  
- Co-signing others’ loans I can’t afford  
- Taking loans to invest in stocks/crypto

---

## My Personal Notes

- Not all debt is bad — but *all debt needs a plan*.  
- I check my **DTI every few months**.  
- I pay more than the minimum.  
- I pause new debt if I'm already repaying.  
- I remind myself: **Peace of mind > owning stuff.**

Debt is just a tool. **Used well, it builds life. Used badly, it builds stress.**  
I’m choosing to use it well.
