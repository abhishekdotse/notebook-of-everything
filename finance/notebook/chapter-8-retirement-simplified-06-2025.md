*"Retire not from work, but from worry."*

## Why I’m Planning for Retirement Now

Most people wait too long to plan — then panic.  
For me, retirement isn’t about stopping work — it’s about **not being forced to work**.  

- Kids’ education, marriage  
- Health costs  
- No regular salary after 60

The earlier I start, the easier it gets thanks to **compounding**.

## How I Estimate My Retirement Need

**Step 1:** Guess monthly expenses after retirement.  
> Example: ₹40,000/month today.

**Step 2:** Account for inflation (say 6%).  
> In 25 years, ₹40K today ≈ ₹1.7L/month.

**Step 3:** Figure out total corpus needed.  
> Roughly ₹3–4 Crores for a 25+ year retirement at 6% post-retirement returns.

## Why Starting Early Matters

> **The later I start, the more I have to save.**

| **Start Age** | **Monthly SIP for ₹1 Crore by 60 (12% return)** |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 25            | ₹2,100                                          |
| 30            | ₹3,400                                          |
| 35            | ₹5,900                                          |
| 40            | ₹10,000                                         |
| 45            | ₹17,000                                         |

- Early start = Smaller monthly amount.  
- Late start = Big monthly burden.

## My Simple Retirement Plan Example

If I’m 30 and want ₹1 Crore by 60:

- **Monthly SIP:** ~₹3,400  
- Split between:  
  - NPS (₹500+/month, with tax benefits)  
  - PPF (safe, long-term)  
  - Equity Mutual Fund SIP (growth)

> I increase investments as my income grows.

## How I Plan to Withdraw

**4% Rule:**  
- Withdraw ~4% of corpus per year.  
- Designed to last 25+ years.

- Example: ₹1.2 Cr corpus → ₹4.8L/year or ₹40,000/month.  
- Add rental income, pension, and annuity if available.
