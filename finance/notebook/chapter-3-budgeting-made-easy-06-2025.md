# Chapter 3: Budgeting Made Easy  
*"If you donâ€™t tell your money where to go, itâ€™ll disappear on its own."*

## Why I Started Budgeting

Budgeting used to sound boring to me â€” like keeping score in a game I didnâ€™t want to play.  
But when I actually tried it, I realized it wasnâ€™t about limits â€” it was about *knowing* where my money goes.

Hereâ€™s what it helps me do:
- Avoid money leaks (hello, unused OTT apps ðŸ‘€)  
- Pay my bills on time  
- Make sure Iâ€™m saving something every month

## Whatâ€™s a Budget, Really?

A **budget** is just a monthly plan that says:
- Whatâ€™s coming in (salary, side gigs, interest)  
- Whatâ€™s going out (groceries, rent)  
- What Iâ€™m saving or investing  

Itâ€™s my way of telling money what to do â€” instead of wondering where it went.

## The 50/30/20 Rule (My Version)

I started using this simple rule:

| **Use**        | **%** | **â‚¹50,000 Example**         |
|----------------|-------|-----------------------------|
| Needs          | 50%   | â‚¹25,000 â†’ Rent, groceries   |
| Wants          | 30%   | â‚¹15,000 â†’ Food, gadgets     |
| Savings/Invest | 20%   | â‚¹10,000 â†’ SIP, PPF, RD      |

Want to save more? Try 40/30/30 â€” Iâ€™m slowly moving toward that!

## My Monthly Budget Template

Hereâ€™s a layout I use in my notebook or budgeting app:

### Final Line:
`Monthly Surplus = Income â€“ (Expenses + Savings)`

## Notes That Help Me Stick to It

- I track spending using a [**Expense Manager & Budget App**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amitm29.am.dailyexpensesmanager&pcampaignid=web_share) on my phone 
- I update my budget at the end of every month  
- If income changes (raise or side income), I adjust my plan  
- If a loan ends, I re-route that EMI into savings

## Final Thought

A budget isnâ€™t a rulebook â€” itâ€™s my money map.  
I tweak it, update it, and grow with it.

Even a simple budget gave me peace of mind â€” and thatâ€™s worth more than any gadget I used to impulse-buy.
