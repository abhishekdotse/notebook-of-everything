# Smart Places for Your Short-Term Savings

## Why I Wrote This

For a long time, I just dumped all my extra money into a single FD. It was safe, sure‚Äîbut not always the smartest use.  

Now I split my short-term savings across **different options** depending on my goals, time horizon, and need for flexibility.  

This is my **personal notebook** on **where I park extra money for anywhere between 1 day and 3 years**.

## My Typical Short-Term Goals

- Emergency fund  
- Planned trips or big expenses  
- Upcoming bills or commitments  

**Key idea:** Keep money **safe**, **accessible**, and earning **better than a plain savings account (~3‚Äì4%)**.

## Important Note

If you're in a **high tax bracket**:

Consider **splitting** between:
- **Arbitrage Funds** ‚Äì tax-efficient short-term parking
- **Debt Funds / FDs** ‚Äì for safety and fixed-date goals

For **emergency or unexpected needs**, I still park money in **Liquid or Overnight Funds** even if they're taxed at slab rate ‚Äî because **liquidity is what matters most**.

---

## My Takeaways

- Don‚Äôt leave extra money idle in your savings account.  
- Choose your parking option based on **goal, timeline, and risk tolerance**.  
- Use **FD for fixed goals**, **Liquid/Overnight for emergencies**.  
- Add **Ultra Short, Low Duration, Money Market** for better yields on 3‚Äì18 month goals.  
- Consider **Arbitrage Funds, T-Bills, Company FDs** for specific situations.  
- Always think about **post-tax returns** ‚Äî plan smartly!
