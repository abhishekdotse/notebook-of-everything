# 🧾 Personal Finance  
*A space to learn, reflect, and grow your money mindset.*

## 👋 Hello & Welcome

Hi! I’m someone who’s learning how to manage money better — and this is my personal finance notebook.  

If you're:
- Earning for the first time  
- Trying to save more  
- Unsure about investing or retirement  
- Or just overwhelmed by all the financial stuff...

You're not alone. I felt the same — and that’s why I started this.

---

## 💡 Why I'm Writing This

Most of us start thinking seriously about money **only when something goes wrong** — a job loss, hospital emergency, wedding, or loan pressure.  

But I wanted to get ahead of those problems — and learn how to manage money step by step.

This notebook is where I:
- Organize what I’ve learned  
- Break things down in plain language  
- Share what’s useful (no technical nonsense)

---

## ⚠️ A Quick Note

> I’m not a finance expert.  
> I’m not selling anything.  
> I’m just learning — and sharing as I go.  
> Please don’t treat this as financial advice. Always check with a certified professional before making big money moves.

# Chapter 1: Know Your Money  
*(Understand where you stand before you move forward)*

---

## Why I Wrote This

Before I started planning my savings or investments, I realized I didn’t even know my full financial picture. So this chapter is just that — getting the basics clear.

Think of this as checking your money's “vitals” — like a doctor would:
- **Income** (what comes in)  
- **Expenses** (what goes out)  
- **Assets** (what I own)  
- **Liabilities** (what I owe)

From these, I track two big things:
- **Net Worth** = Assets – Liabilities  
- **Cash Flow** = Income – Expenses

---

## My Net Worth: Where I Stand

**What is it?**  
The total value of everything I own minus what I owe.

**Formula:**  
`Net Worth = Total Assets – Total Liabilities`

### Example:

| **Assets**              | ₹ Value     |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| Savings Account         | ₹50,000     |
| Fixed Deposits (FDs)    | ₹1,20,000   |
| Mutual Funds            | ₹80,000     |
| Gold & Jewellery        | ₹1,00,000   |
| Car                     | ₹3,00,000   |
| House (Market Value)    | ₹35,00,000  |
| **Total Assets**        | ₹41,50,000  |

| **Liabilities**         | ₹ Value     |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| Home Loan               | ₹20,00,000  |
| Car Loan                | ₹1,50,000   |
| Credit Card Dues        | ₹20,000     |
| **Total Liabilities**   | ₹21,70,000  |

**Net Worth = ₹41,50,000 – ₹21,70,000 = ₹19,80,000**

Positive = I'm building wealth  
Negative = Need to reduce loans and rethink expenses

---

## Assets vs Liabilities (Quick View)

| **Assets**          | **Liabilities**       |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| What I own          | What I owe             |
| FD, house, mutual funds | Loans, credit cards |
| Should grow         | Should shrink          |

---

## Cash Flow: My Monthly Snapshot

**Formula:**  
`Cash Flow = Monthly Income – Monthly Expenses`

### Example Breakdown:

**Income:**

| Source            | ₹ Amount |
|-------------------|----------|
| Salary (after tax)| ₹60,000  |
| Freelance Work    | ₹5,000   |
| Investment Returns| ₹2,000   |
| **Total Income**  | ₹67,000  |

**Expenses:**

| Category             | ₹ Amount |
|----------------------|----------|
| Rent                 | ₹15,000  |
| Groceries            | ₹7,000   |
| Bills (electricity, phone, etc.) | ₹3,000 |
| Transport            | ₹4,000   |
| Insurance            | ₹3,000   |
| Eating Out & Fun     | ₹4,000   |
| Loan EMI             | ₹10,000  |
| Miscellaneous        | ₹5,000   |
| **Total Expenses**   | ₹51,000  |

**Monthly Surplus = ₹67,000 – ₹51,000 = ₹16,000**

That ₹16,000? I save part of it, invest some, and keep a little aside for fun.

---

## How I Track My Spending

- I use the [**Expense Manager & Budget App**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amitm29.am.dailyexpensesmanager&pcampaignid=web_share) on my phone  
- I try to update it right after every expense  
- It takes 10 seconds, and gives me control over my month

---

## Summary Tips

- Check your **net worth once a year**  
- Keep your **monthly cash flow positive**  
- Pay off debts quickly  
- Grow assets that increase in value — like mutual funds, gold, or real estate

---

# Chapter 2: Set Financial Goals  
*“If you don’t know where you're going, any road will take you there.”*

---

## Why I Needed This Chapter

I used to save money randomly — a bit here, a bit there. But I never knew *what* I was saving for. That changed once I started writing down my goals.

A **financial goal** just means giving your money a job:  
> “What do I want to do with my money, and by when?”

---

## My Goal Types (With Examples)

| **Goal Type**   | **Time Frame** | **Examples**                                 |
|------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Short-Term       | 0–3 years      | Emergency fund, phone upgrade, vacation       |
| Medium-Term      | 3–7 years      | Wedding, car, higher studies                  |
| Long-Term        | 7+ years       | Retirement, child’s education, home purchase  |

---

## The SMART Goal Trick

I follow the **SMART method** when writing financial goals:

- **S**pecific → What exactly do I want?  
- **M**easurable → How much money is needed?  
- **A**chievable → Can I afford it?  
- **R**ealistic → Is it doable with my income/lifestyle?  
- **T**ime-bound → By when?

Example:  
> “Save ₹10 lakhs for my daughter’s MBA in 10 years.”

---

## Quick Estimate: How Much Should I Save?

Here’s the basic idea:  
> The earlier I start, the less I have to save each month.

### Rough Estimate Example:

Let’s say I want ₹10 lakhs in 10 years.  
I invest in a mutual fund expecting 10% annual returns.

- One-time: Save ₹4 lakhs now  
- OR Monthly: Save ~₹6,000 through SIP

It doesn’t have to be perfect — just start planning early.

---

## My Goal Planning Table

| **Goal**              | **Type**       | **Target ₹** | **Years Left** | **Priority** |
|------------------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| Daughter’s Education   | Long-Term      | ₹10,00,000   | 10             | High         |
| Buy a Car              | Medium-Term    | ₹8,00,000    | 3              | Medium       |
| Vacation               | Short-Term     | ₹2,00,000    | 2              | Low          |
| Emergency Fund         | Short-Term     | ₹3,00,000    | 1              | High         |

---

## Matching Goals to Investment Options

| **Goal Type**  | **Suggested Tools**                                   |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Short-Term     | FD, RD, Liquid Mutual Funds                           |
| Medium-Term    | Debt Funds, Hybrid Funds, Gold ETFs                   |
| Long-Term      | Equity MFs, PPF, NPS, Govt Bonds, Post Office Schemes |

---

## Mini Exercise (Takes 5 mins)

1. Write down 3 things you want to do with your money  
2. Label each as: Need / Want / Wish  
3. Add an amount + time frame  
4. Prioritize and plan how to save for them

---

## My Takeaways

- Goals give my money purpose  
- SMART goals = Less confusion, better action  
- Different goals = Different saving strategies  
- I’ll review my list once or twice a year to stay on track

---

# Chapter 3: Budgeting Made Easy  
*"If you don’t tell your money where to go, it’ll disappear on its own."*

---

## Why I Started Budgeting

Budgeting used to sound boring to me — like keeping score in a game I didn’t want to play.  
But when I actually tried it, I realized it wasn’t about limits — it was about *knowing* where my money goes.

Here’s what it helps me do:
- Avoid money leaks (hello, unused OTT apps 👀)  
- Pay my bills on time  
- Make sure I’m saving something every month  

---

## What’s a Budget, Really?

A **budget** is just a monthly plan that says:
- What’s coming in (salary, side gigs, interest)  
- What’s going out (groceries, rent)  
- What I’m saving or investing  

It’s my way of telling money what to do — instead of wondering where it went.

---

## My Basic Budget Categories

| **Category**           | **Examples**                            |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Income                 | Salary, freelance, rent, dividends      |
| Fixed Expenses         | Rent, EMIs, insurance                   |
| Variable Expenses      | Groceries, petrol, utilities            |
| Discretionary Spending | Eating out, Netflix, impulse shopping   |
| Savings & Investments  | SIPs, PPF, gold, emergency fund         |

---

## The 50/30/20 Rule (My Version)

I started using this simple rule:

| **Use**        | **%** | **₹50,000 Example**         |
|----------------|-------|-----------------------------|
| Needs          | 50%   | ₹25,000 → Rent, groceries   |
| Wants          | 30%   | ₹15,000 → Food, gadgets     |
| Savings/Invest | 20%   | ₹10,000 → SIP, PPF, RD      |

Want to save more? Try 40/30/30 — I’m slowly moving toward that!

---

## My Monthly Budget Template

Here’s a layout I use in my notebook or budgeting app:

### Income

| **Source**        | **Amount ₹** |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Salary            |              |
| Freelance/Other   |              |
| Investment Income |              |
| **Total Income**  | ₹            |

### Expenses

| **Category**            | **Amount ₹** |
|-------------------------|--------------|
| Rent/EMI                |              |
| Groceries               |              |
| Electricity/Water Bills |              |
| Mobile/Internet         |              |
| Fuel/Transport          |              |
| Insurance               |              |
| Dining/Movies           |              |
| Shopping/Misc           |              |
| **Total Expenses**      | ₹            |

### Savings & Investments

| **Saving Type**       | **Amount ₹** |
|------------------------|--------------|
| SIPs / Mutual Funds    |              |
| PPF / EPF              |              |
| RD / FD                |              |
| Gold Savings           |              |
| Emergency Fund         |              |
| **Total Savings**      | ₹            |

### Final Line:
`Monthly Surplus = Income – (Expenses + Savings)`

---

## Notes That Help Me Stick to It

- I track spending using a [**Expense Manager & Budget App**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amitm29.am.dailyexpensesmanager&pcampaignid=web_share) on my phone 
- I update my budget at the end of every month  
- If income changes (raise or side income), I adjust my plan  
- If a loan ends, I re-route that EMI into savings

---

## Final Thought

A budget isn’t a rulebook — it’s my money map.  
I tweak it, update it, and grow with it.

Even a simple budget gave me peace of mind — and that’s worth more than any gadget I used to impulse-buy.

---

# Chapter 4: Save Smart, Live Smart  
*"Don’t save what is left after spending. Spend what is left after saving." – Warren Buffett*

---

## Why I Started Saving Differently

I used to think I just needed to earn more to feel financially secure.  
But then I realized: **without saving first, more money just means more spending.**

Doesn’t matter if I earn ₹20K or ₹2L — if I don’t save **before** spending, I often end up with nothing by month-end.

---

## What Saving Really Means (For Me)

Saving = Money I **set aside with intention** — for emergencies, future goals, or investing.  

That doesn’t include:
- Whatever is left at the end of the month  
- Gold I buy randomly  
- Money sitting in my low-interest bank account doing nothing

---

## My 3 Golden Saving Rules

### 1. **Pay Myself First**

Before I pay bills, I move money to:
- My SIP  
- My RD or PPF  
- Emergency Fund

**Automate it** with standing instructions so I don’t forget.

---

### 2. **Make It a Habit**

Started with:
- ₹500/month SIP  
- ₹1,000 RD  
- ₹100/week cash savings jar  

Small amounts helped me get into the rhythm — and it feels good watching it grow.

---

## How Much Should I Save?

I started with **20% of my income** — and aim for 30% now.

| **Monthly Income** | **Target Saving (20%)** |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| ₹25,000            | ₹5,000                   |
| ₹50,000            | ₹10,000                  |
| ₹75,000            | ₹15,000                  |
| ₹1,00,000          | ₹20,000                  |

Even **₹2,000/month in SIPs** can become **₹6–7 lakhs in 10 years**.  
That’s the power of consistency.

---

## Saving vs Investing (I Keep It Simple)

| **Aspect**       | **Saving**               | **Investing**                     |
|------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Purpose          | Safety, emergency fund   | Grow wealth, reach long-term goals|
| Returns          | Low, fixed               | Higher, but variable              |
| Risk             | Very low                 | Depends on where I invest         |
| Tools            | FD, RD, PPF              | Mutual Funds, Stocks, NPS         |
| Time Horizon     | Short–Medium             | Medium–Long                       |

I save for peace of mind, and invest to grow money for future goals.

## How I Handle My Salary: A Simple System That Works

One thing that really changed my money habits was this:  
**The moment my salary hits, I don’t leave it sitting there.**

Here’s what I do — maybe it’ll work for you too:

### My 3-Account Rule

| **Account Type**     | **Purpose**                               |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Salary Account       | Where my income lands                     |
| Expenses Account     | Monthly spending money (rent, groceries)  |
| Savings Account      | For saving and investing only             |

### My Flow (Right After Salary Is Credited)

1. **Transfer a fixed amount to my savings account**  
   This goes into SIPs, RDs, PPF, or gold over the month

2. **Move my monthly budget into my expenses account**  
   Rent, food, transport — all spend from this account

3. **Leave the salary account nearly empty**  
   This way, I don’t accidentally spend what I meant to save

### A Trick That Helps:
> Whatever is *left* in the **expense account** at month-end is **next month’s buffer** — or bonus savings!

It’s a simple system — but it gave me structure, clarity, and reduced my stress about money.

## Mini Saving Habit Tracker

| **Week** | **₹ Saved** | **Notes**           |

| Week 1   |             |                      |
| Week 2   |             |                      |
| Week 3   |             |                      |
| Week 4   |             |                      |
| **Total**| ₹ ________  |                      |

This simple log helps me stay aware and motivated.

---

## Quick Reminders I Gave Myself

- **Save before you spend** — not after  
- Automate it — remove the friction  
- Don’t let money just sit — put it to work  
- Small amounts saved regularly = big wins later  
- Choose tools based on what I’m saving for (not just returns)

---

Saving gave me breathing space, peace of mind, and the confidence to plan ahead.  
It’s the *quiet superpower* that changed how I look at money.
