## 👋 Hello & Welcome

Hi! I’m someone who’s learning how to manage money better — and this is my personal finance notebook.  

If you're:
- Earning for the first time  
- Trying to save more  
- Unsure about investing or retirement  
- Or just overwhelmed by all the financial stuff...

You're not alone. I felt the same — and that’s why I started this.

## 💡 Why I'm Writing This

Most of us start thinking seriously about money **only when something goes wrong** — a job loss, hospital emergency, wedding, or loan pressure.  

But I wanted to get ahead of those problems — and learn how to manage money step by step.

This notebook is where I:
- Organize what I’ve learned  
- Break things down in plain language  
- Share what’s useful (no technical nonsense)

---

## ⚠️ A Quick Note

> I’m not a finance expert.  
> I’m not selling anything.  
> I’m just learning — and sharing as I go.  
> Please don’t treat this as financial advice. Always check with a certified professional before making big money moves.

## Chapter 1: Know Your Money  
*(Understand where you stand before you move forward)*

---

## Why I Wrote This

Before I started planning my savings or investments, I realized I didn’t even know my full financial picture. So this chapter is just that — getting the basics clear.

Think of this as checking your money's “vitals” — like a doctor would:
- **Income** (what comes in)  
- **Expenses** (what goes out)  
- **Assets** (what I own)  
- **Liabilities** (what I owe)

From these, I track two big things:
- **Net Worth** = Assets – Liabilities  
- **Cash Flow** = Income – Expenses

---

## My Net Worth: Where I Stand

**What is it?**  
The total value of everything I own minus what I owe.

**Formula:**  
`Net Worth = Total Assets – Total Liabilities`

### Example:

| **Assets**              | ₹ Value     |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| Savings Account         | ₹50,000     |
| Fixed Deposits (FDs)    | ₹1,20,000   |
| Mutual Funds            | ₹80,000     |
| Gold & Jewellery        | ₹1,00,000   |
| Car                     | ₹3,00,000   |
| House (Market Value)    | ₹35,00,000  |
| **Total Assets**        | ₹41,50,000  |

| **Liabilities**         | ₹ Value     |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| Home Loan               | ₹20,00,000  |
| Car Loan                | ₹1,50,000   |
| Credit Card Dues        | ₹20,000     |
| **Total Liabilities**   | ₹21,70,000  |

**Net Worth = ₹41,50,000 – ₹21,70,000 = ₹19,80,000**

Positive = I'm building wealth  
Negative = Need to reduce loans and rethink expenses

---

## Assets vs Liabilities (Quick View)

| **Assets**          | **Liabilities**       |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| What I own          | What I owe             |
| FD, house, mutual funds | Loans, credit cards |
| Should grow         | Should shrink          |

---

## Cash Flow: My Monthly Snapshot

**Formula:**  
`Cash Flow = Monthly Income – Monthly Expenses`

### Example Breakdown:

**Income:**

| Source            | ₹ Amount |
|-------------------|----------|
| Salary (after tax)| ₹60,000  |
| Freelance Work    | ₹5,000   |
| Investment Returns| ₹2,000   |
| **Total Income**  | ₹67,000  |

**Expenses:**

| Category             | ₹ Amount |
|----------------------|----------|
| Rent                 | ₹15,000  |
| Groceries            | ₹7,000   |
| Bills (electricity, phone, etc.) | ₹3,000 |
| Transport            | ₹4,000   |
| Insurance            | ₹3,000   |
| Eating Out & Fun     | ₹4,000   |
| Loan EMI             | ₹10,000  |
| Miscellaneous        | ₹5,000   |
| **Total Expenses**   | ₹51,000  |

**Monthly Surplus = ₹67,000 – ₹51,000 = ₹16,000**

That ₹16,000? I save part of it, invest some, and keep a little aside for fun.

## How I Track My Spending

- I use the [**Expense Manager & Budget App**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amitm29.am.dailyexpensesmanager&pcampaignid=web_share) on my phone  
- I try to update it right after every expense  
- It takes 10 seconds, and gives me control over my month
